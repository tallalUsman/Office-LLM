# The Office Reboot: LLM cut
## LLM model fine-trained on the Office (US) transcripts.

 Use Bloom base model with qlora for fine-tuning and huggingface to store the model and dataset.

## Output:

Heres the sample output generated by the model:
```
Creed: DWIGHT! 
[Creed and Dwight grapple for a moment before other office members intervene]
Dwight: You are a disgrace.

Creed, catching his breath: You stole my special mung beans from the break room! 

Dwight, defiantly: They were fermenting and smelled like death!

Pam, trying to keep the peace: Okay, guys, let's calm down. Creed, we can get you more mung beans.

Jim, smirking: Maybe even ones that don't double as a biohazard.

Michael, stepping in: Alright, alright, break it up! This office is a place of work, not... whatever this was.

Creed, grumbling: Just wait until we're outside, Dwight.

Dwight, holding up a beet: Bring it on, Creed. I've trained with tougher adversaries than you.

Stanley, not looking up from his crossword: Can we get back to work now? Some of us are trying to do as little as possible before 5.

Kevin, nodding: Yeah, and some of us are just hungry.

Angela, disdainfully: As always.

Michael, trying to regain control: Meeting in the conference room, five minutes! We're going to discuss office etiquette. And maybe where to get more mung beans.
